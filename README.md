Abstract: 
Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection remains challenging for deep learning models, particularly when test-time OOD samples differ significantly from training outliers. We propose OODD, a novel test-time OOD detection method that dynamically maintains and updates an OOD dictionary without fine-tuning...

## Setup
For OpenOOD benchmark, please refer to [OpenOOD](https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenOOD/blob/main/README.md).

## Running the code
```bash
the code will be released soon.
```
